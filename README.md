# Win-11-UI-Restart
Sometimes when I start windows 11 the search bar is very slow. This is a python script to restart it. I have it run on startup through a bat file and it seems to have fixed my issue. All it does is restart the process responsible for the windows taskbar. 

If you want to set it up the way I have yourself the bat file will be included.
Change the file path in the bat file to where you saved the script.
Create a shortcut of the bat file and put it in your startup folder.
To find this folder press Win + R and type shell:startup then click okay and it will take you to the folder. 

I have only tested this script on win11 but I'm sure it probably works on older versions as well.
