# Win-11-UI-Restart
I am probably the only person having this problem but sometimes when I start windows 11 the search bar is very slow. This is a python script to restart it. I have it run on startup through a bat file and it seems to have fixed my issue. All it does is restart the process responsible for the windows taskbar.
